# Note
I have halted development of Tristris 2 in favour of a rewrite in Typescript. If you are interested in following the progress of this work, please continue over to the [new repository](https://github.com/tristan00b/tengine).

# Tristris 2

Note: *Tristris 2* is still in development and should not be expected to work yet!
